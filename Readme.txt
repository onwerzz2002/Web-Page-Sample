1. For the purpose of testing the function of second-top left information and link(clickable), I extracted some
   pargraphs from and link all of them to a website "http://michaeljosephfilms.com/" in convenience. 
   If anything improper, just let me know.

2. For the twitter feed, I also put some quotes as paragraph out of testing. The are from Walt Disney,
   Judy Garland, John Lubbuck, George Bemard Shaw, and Elbert Hubband.
